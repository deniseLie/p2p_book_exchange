## Features

- Request and manage book exchanges.
- Real-time status updates for exchanges.

## Future extension 
This project aims to evolve into a "Facebook for book lovers" with additional features, including:
- Social Media Integration
    - WHY? : Foster a sense of community and engagement among users = retain user
    - Follow/Followed System: Introduce a feed where users can see updates from the people they follow (e.g., books added to their library, reviews posted, reading progress).
    - Personal Library: Allow customizationâ€”users can organize books into categories (e.g., "Read," "To Read," "Wishlist").
    - Gamification: Introduce badges for milestones (e.g., "Reviewed 10 books," "Added 50 books to the library").
    - Share: to show off to their friends and families

- Recommendation System:
    - Users can list books they're interested in, and the system will match them with other users' libraries, considering location and preferences.
    
- Messaging App centralized
    - will be similar to carousel where both users will discuss and decide mainly on the messaging app
    - will have more advance feature in the messaging (integrated book inventory, updated status on the messaging feature)
-   Different type of notifications 
- Review user and book
- Revenue Model:
    - Instead of charging users, the app will generate revenue through advertisements, once enough traction is gained.
